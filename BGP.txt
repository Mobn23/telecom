How BGP Uses These:
    When a router in one AS wants to send data to another AS, it looks at the AS Path to decide the best route.
    BGP helps routers choose the shortest or most reliable path based on AS Path length, and in some cases, other factors like policy or weight assigned by network administrators.
In Summary:
    AS number: Identifies a network (AS) in BGP communication.
    AS Path: Lists all the ASes the data passes through, used for loop prevention and path selection.
    Next-Hop: Tells the router the next IP address to send the data to.
    These attributes are essential in BGP to help data travel efficiently across the internet from one AS to another.
