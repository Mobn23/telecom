I built a HTTP protocol on top of TCP protocol so i refactored the already TCP code with adjustments that align with the requirements.
Then took a look on the response on terminal & the packets on Wireshark with many filters:

1. Filtered HTTP between 2 IPs:
    ip.addr == 192.168.50.208 && ip.addr == 46.30.213.174 && http
        So here filtered the captured packets to capture only the HTTP packets between the client & the server and took a deep look on the different columns Time, Src, Dst ..etc so could see all the requests & responses between those 2 devices(My computer & the remote server).
        Then i generated a Flow graph (Statistics -> Flow graph) on Wireshark & printed it.

2. Filter Wireshark to captured only Client HTTP packets:
    ip.src == 192.168.50.208 && http
        Here filtered displaying only the client's HTTP packets, then clicked on the last packet right click -> Follow -> HTTP stream
        Then printed the result (result contains all the requests from client to the Server).


3. Filter Wireshark to captured only Server HTTP packets:
    ip.src == 46.30.213.174 && http
        Here filtered displaying only the Server's HTTP packets, then clicked on the last packet right click -> Follow -> HTTP stream
        Then printed the result (result contains all the responses from Server to the Client).

Mostly everthing worked easily but it too me long time studying the lectures so understanding the protocols was essencial for this submission. As well as learned how to use Wireshark & what info can we be obtained from it.
