TCP uses socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM) and calls methods like connect and accept.
UDP uses socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM) and makes use of sendto and recvfrom without establishing a connection.

HTTP is build on TCP always it's built-in in request libraries but now we wanna create it manually.
High-level libraries (like requests in Python) hide TCP behind simpler function calls to send HTTP requests. Under the hood, they still create a TCP socket, connect, and then send your GET request. In this assignment, we' re just doing all of those steps by hand.

lÃ¶nedator ip : 192.168.50.208
Filter HTTP between 2 IPs:
ip.addr == 192.168.50.208 && ip.addr == 46.30.213.174 && http

Now filter Wireshark to capture only Client HTTP packets:
ip.src == 192.168.50.208 && http

Now filter Wireshark to capture only Server HTTP packets:
ip.src == 46.30.213.174 && http

So as for B3 task:
Download and install Wireshark
Start a packet capture in Wireshark before running the script
Run the Python script
Stop the capture
(Or we can capture 1st then run teh code it will be updated)
Filter packets by typing "http" in the filter box or by using the server's IP address
Examine both the request and response packets by right-clicking on them and selecting "Follow > HTTP Stream"
